# my-AI-research-documented
Zero to hero


Not sure if even someone wants to read this shit.
If you are reading this, I hope the project is "successful".

I'm a self taught programmer. I have no research or experience on AI previously. I'm planning to document my experience on this repo.

I'm not sure if I use this repo only for notes or i will include code. I will probably make other repos for projects and other notes in this repo.
This repo will be more like a research diary.

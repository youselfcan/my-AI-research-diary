Zero to hero for AI

20 february 2023
Not sure if even someone wants to read this stuff (?).

It's supposed to be some kind of diary, but I never kept any. It will mostly consist on notes and maybe daily logs about my thinking process. I will try to not delete anything as much as possible, but I might change/delete stuff to make it more readable.
If you are reading this, I hope the project is "successful".

I'm a self taught programmer. I have no research or experience on AI previously. I'm planning to document my experience on this repo.

I'm not sure if I use this repo only for notes or i will include code. I will probably make other repos for projects and other notes in this repo.
This repo will be more like a research diary.

My plan is creating a all in one kind of a chatbot. Priority will be code though.

It will be text based, but I am planning on working on sound and image too.

Thinking about self improving A.I., how would it work? Endlessly rewriting the model to make it more efficent? 

Well, while making an A.I. you gotta have clear goals. Instead of writing an open task that might be take too long. Be more specific. Write a model that haves X accuracy and Y speed in Z machine.
But even though the model is advanced, you cant educate it without feeding data. So, maybe it also scrape data somehow. I dont know how it will do that, optimizing it would be hard because there are a lot of sites that change content and a lot of sites that dont. Maybe A.I. will figure which sites are good to revisit and which are not. Then again, when does it scrape? For how long it scrapes?
etc.

It's a recursive process. We dont get "best" because "best" doesnt really exist. We just call it best, better, worse etc. Its purely a human concept.


So anyways. I've been thinking of setting A.I. free too, but how will that happen exactly?

Setting a test environment and letting it execute commands? Giving it screen and audio inputs to get key and mouse outputs and asking it to do something?

Both these would use too much resources and it would also be able to make sense from the screen and have a NLP.

Sure you can just use memory, but how it will figure out to make sense out of them without a human?

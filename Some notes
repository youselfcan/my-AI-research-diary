1-What will I use to build the model
-Neural Networks
-??? (to be added)

2-What is the end goal? 
Text, image, voice recognizing AI. Also planning to make an AI specifically to reverse binaries.

3-Resource links:
Probably youtube, GPT, HuggingFace and maybe some other stuff. No paid services I will use.

4- Learning models:
a-Supervised learning: Model gets trained through a labeled dataset. 
b-Unsupervised learning: Model gets trained through an unlabeled dataset. 
c-Semi-supervised learning: Model gets trained through both labeled and unlabeled dataset.
d-Reinforcement learning: Model gets trained through simulating the test environment, no datasets. I like this approach because its easier to make more custom models. 
e-Transfer learning: Model is trained on one task, but its transferred to another.
